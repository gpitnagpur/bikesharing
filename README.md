Overview
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a robust regression model to analyze the factors influencing bike rentals (cnt) and predict future demand. Key objectives include:

Accurate Demand Prediction: Improve forecasting for daily rentals.
Understand Influencing Factors: Identify variables significantly affecting bike usage patterns.
Strategic Business Support: Enable optimized planning and resource distribution.
Dataset:
The dataset provides details of daily bike rentals, including weather, seasonal, and temporal factors. It includes the target variable cnt (total rentals) and several independent variables.

Key Insights
Seasonal Trends:

Rentals are highest during summer and fall, with a noticeable dip in winter.
Recommendation: Tailor marketing campaigns to boost winter demand.
Weather Effects:

Clear weather correlates with higher rentals, while snowy and rainy conditions reduce demand.
Recommendation: Use dynamic pricing or discounts during adverse weather.
Temperature Influence:

Both actual temperature (temp) and perceived temperature (atemp) strongly affect demand.
Recommendation: Ensure sufficient bike availability during warmer days.
Yearly Growth:

Bike rentals grew significantly in 2019 compared to 2018.
Recommendation: Leverage this growth trend to expand services in high-demand areas.
Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and model development.
Key Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: Numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: Machine learning and model evaluation.
Steps Performed
Data Loading:

Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure and attributes.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Converted categorical variables like season, weathersit, and yr to descriptive names.
Handled missing values and encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection:

Dropped irrelevant columns (instant, dteday, casual, registered) to focus on predictive features.
Model Development:

Built a multiple linear regression model using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model using key metrics:
R-squared
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Visualization:

Visualized data relationships and residuals to ensure assumptions were met:
Distribution of rentals.
Correlation heatmap.
Actual vs predicted values.
Residual analysis.
Results Export:

Saved the predicted vs actual rental data to a CSV file for future analysis.
